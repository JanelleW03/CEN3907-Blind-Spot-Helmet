Time Log:

1/15 - setup up log in github as 3rd part reference

1/19 - 3 hours (team meeting)
  - ordered temporary Lidar sensor to use for testing (Alpha build)
  - began wiring arduino components and raspberry pi together
  - planned rest of week's work with team

1/20 - 2 hours (individual/team meeting)
  - aided Devika and Janelle in proving raspi functionality with ultrasonic distance and haptic sensors (moved from arduino to raspi)
  - began setting up ssh for the Raspi for future parallel team work

1/22 - 3 hours (team meeting)
  - met with group before stakeholder check-in to discuss changing scope of project for alpha build specifically
  - Check-in meeting with stakeholder to discuss changes
  - implemented ssh for Raspi for future parallel independent/team work
  - made plan for 3d modeling of helmet module and next steps

1/23 - 2 hours (individual/team meeting)
  - met with Emily to work on 3d-modeled helmet module on Onshape
  - brainstormed new ideas for module implementation

1/27 - 2 hours (individual/team meeting)
  - worked on 3d model initial idea (sliding mount and housing module) on Onshape
  - used actual component measurements to create prototype model, with hole placements for components being considered (haptic wires, charger, etc.)
  - started printing first model

1/29 - 3 hours (team meeting)
  - researched helmet attachment mechanisms; considered weight of module, weather resistance, and more
  - made adjustments to 3d model to comfortably fit lidar sensors out of range of each others view

2/3 - 3 hours (team meeting)
  - alpha demo, made more adjustments to 3d model and reprinted

2/10 - 4 hours (team meeting)
  - edited and printed final beta prototype of 3d model, with full consideration of how we desired that the components would reside in the module
  - included button and led placement, adjustments to lidar sensor holes, and haptic hole placement

2/12 - 3 hours (team meeting)
  - placed all components within new module to demonstrate potential final products
  - beta check-in meeting
  - rewired/replaced wires between raspberry pi, breadboard, and lidar to make everything fit more comfortably and look more polished
  - considered changing gpio assignments on raspberry pi to accomodate for the second lidar and haptic sensor

2/17
