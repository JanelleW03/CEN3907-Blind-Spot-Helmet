Time Log:
1/15 - 30 min: setup up log in github as 3rd part reference

1/19 - 3 hrs: team meeting to discuss future plans for Thursday demo and alpha build presentation
    - ordered temporary Lidar sensor to use for testing (Alpha build)
    - began wiring arduino components and raspberry pi together
    - planned rest of week's work with team

1/20 - 3 hrs: Raspi & sensor testing
    - proved raspi functionality with ultrasonic distance and haptic sensors (moved from arduino to raspi)
    - designed and tested code  (bat.py)
    - rewrote tests to have the same functionailty as on the arduino
    - shh the raspi for future easy use 
    - also cleaned up the timelog and added the previous semesters time log

1/21 - 4 hrs: Lidar testing and integration, team meeting, professor check-in
    - received lidar sensor and began testing with raspi
    - discussed progress and next steps with team and professor
    - we decided to move from AI camera to Lidar for obstacle detection (easier inegration and the camera was not fast enough for our needs)
    - got a complete working demo with distance sensor, led, and haptic sensor with little to no bugs
    - developed plan for completed Alpha demo (battery, 3D printed housing, wiring, code integration)
