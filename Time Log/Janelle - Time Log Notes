Time Log:
1/15 - 30 min: setup up log in github as 3rd part reference

1/19 - 3 hrs: team meeting to discuss future plans for Thursday demo and alpha build presentation
    - ordered temporary Lidar sensor to use for testing (Alpha build)
    - began wiring arduino components and raspberry pi together
    - planned rest of week's work with team

1/20 - 3 hrs: Raspi & sensor testing
    - proved raspi functionality with ultrasonic distance and haptic sensors (moved from arduino to raspi)
    - designed and tested code  (bat.py)
    - rewrote tests to have the same functionailty as on the arduino
    - shh the raspi for future easy use 
    - also cleaned up the timelog and added the previous semesters time log

1/21 - 4 hrs: Lidar testing and integration, team meeting, professor check-in
    - received lidar sensor and began testing with raspi
    - discussed progress and next steps with team and professor
    - we decided to move from AI camera to Lidar for obstacle detection (easier inegration and the camera was not fast enough for our needs)
    - got a complete working demo with distance sensor, led, and haptic sensor with little to no bugs
    - developed plan for completed Alpha demo (battery, 3D printed housing, wiring, code integration)

1/22 - 3 hrs: meeting with stakholder
    - met with Alex and discussed the future of the project
    - also met with the team separately to talk about the demo for the alpha build
    - staged a mini demo for the alpha build with all components we had working at the time including: UD and LED on the raspi
    - researched for the LiDar we need to order

1/26 - 4hrs: lidar fully integrated & PCB discussion
    - initialized the UART for the LiDar
    - got the lidar fully functional using examples from the following websites:
        - https://makersportal.com/blog/distance-detection-with-the-tf-luna-lidar-and-raspberry-pi?srsltid=AfmBOor3_qmpS5YuLqr8yXoOtPq9wEVS-RkVBo3wcFVprpydy6TLWDue
    - the full circuit is functional with the distance sensor, light, and lidar sensor
    - researched and explored options for making a PCB for the future, very much still in the works but its something out stakeholder had mentioned in our last meeting

2/3 - 4  hrs: team/mentor meeting and on/off button integration
    - had alpha build demo
    - worked out kinks with on/off button and now works with no known bugs
    - discussed future plans for beta build 
    - printed another iteraion of the housing unit
    - did research on better wiring connections
    - also made it possible to push code to github from raspi terminal
    need to do: figure out concise wiring (perhaps jst connectors) and switch to RGB LED (yellow = idle, green = detection, off = system is off)


TOTAL HOURS: 23.5
