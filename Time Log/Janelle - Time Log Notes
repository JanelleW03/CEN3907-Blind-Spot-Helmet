Time Log:
1/15 - 1.5: setup up log in github as 3rd part reference
    - GitHub repository setup
    - Log structure creation
    - Project planning and documentation setup

1/19 - 3 hrs: team meeting to discuss future plans for Thursday demo and alpha build presentation
    - ordered temporary Lidar sensor to use for testing (Alpha build)
    - began wiring arduino components and raspberry pi together
    - planned rest of week's work with team

1/20 - 3 hrs: Raspi & sensor testing
    - proved raspi functionality with ultrasonic distance and haptic sensors (moved from arduino to raspi)
    - designed and tested code  (bat.py)
    - rewrote tests to have the same functionailty as on the arduino
    - shh the raspi for future easy use 
    - also cleaned up the timelog and added the previous semesters time log

1/21 - 4 hrs: Lidar testing and integration, team meeting, professor check-in
    - received lidar sensor and began testing with raspi
    - discussed progress and next steps with team and professor
    - we decided to move from AI camera to Lidar for obstacle detection (easier inegration and the camera was not fast enough for our needs)
    - got a complete working demo with distance sensor, led, and haptic sensor with little to no bugs
    - developed plan for completed Alpha demo (battery, 3D printed housing, wiring, code integration)

1/22 - 3 hrs: meeting with stakholder
    - met with Alex and discussed the future of the project
    - also met with the team separately to talk about the demo for the alpha build
    - researched for the LiDar we need to order

1/25 - 5 hrs: wotrking out kinks in the system
    - staged a mini demo for the alpha build with all components we had working at the time including: UD and LED on the raspi
    - serial communication debugging, trying to speed up the system
    - Refactoring bat.py for stability

1/26 - 5 hrs: lidar fully integrated & PCB discussion
    - initialized the UART for the LiDar
    - got the lidar fully functional using examples from the following websites:
        - https://makersportal.com/blog/distance-detection-with-the-tf-luna-lidar-and-raspberry-pi?srsltid=AfmBOor3_qmpS5YuLqr8yXoOtPq9wEVS-RkVBo3wcFVprpydy6TLWDue
    - the full circuit is functional with the distance sensor, light, and lidar sensor
    - researched and explored options for making a PCB for the future, very much still in the works but its something out stakeholder had mentioned in our last meeting
    - added an on/off button but there are some kinks to work out

2/3 - 6 hrs: team/mentor meeting and on/off button integration
    - had alpha build demo
    - worked out kinks with on/off button and now works with no known bugs
    - discussed future plans for beta build 
    - printed another iteraion of the housing unit
    - did research on better wiring connections
    - also made it possible to push code to github from raspi terminal
    need to do: figure out concise wiring (perhaps jst connectors) and switch to RGB LED (yellow = idle, green = detection, off = system is off)

2/7 - 2 hrs: 3D model and RGB 
    - adding RGB to indicate different states of the system (red off, yellow idle, green detection)
    - looked into batteries for the raspi
    - using the first iteration of the casing to be mounted on the helmet I attempt to get all components to fit (not successful)

2/10 - 3 hrs: 3D adjustments and team meeting
    - worked with Ana to get all needed adjustments for the 3D model and started printing iteration 2
    - ordered the second lidar sensor
    - completely moved all components to a smaller breadboard to make casing easier in the future (cutting resistors shorter etc.)

2/12 - 2 hrs:
    - worked with the RGB LED again, the code seems to be fully functional but wiring is a bit of an issue
    - fully removed the UD sensor in preperation for the second lidar sensor
    - adjusted wiring to allow easier placement into the raspi casing 

2/17 - 5 hrs - adding second lidar 
    - research multiple uart configuration on raspberry pi and debug issues with enabling uart2
    - fixed systemd script and set alphabuild.py to run on startup
    - modify code for two lidars
    - added a battery pack so the system is more mobile and not reliant on being near a computer to power it

2/18 - 2 hrs - added second haptic and working on RGB LED 
    - there is a bug with the RGB LED where its not turning on
    - took out the button to turn the system on and off because there is a on/off switch on the battery pack itself

2/19 - 3 hrs - RGB LED bug
    - spent more time working on getting the LED to work and had to switch out the components after some research
