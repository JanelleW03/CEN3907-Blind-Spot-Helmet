Time Log:
1/15 - setup up log in github as 3rd part reference
1/19 - 3 hrs - reviewed work from last semester, researched and purchased LIDAR sensor to use, found 
  example raspberry pi code to connect UDS and haptics
1/19 - 2 hrs - moved CNN model over to Colab, re-trained, and attempted conversion from Pytorch to tflite
1/20 - 2 hrs - created sample Python script (bat.py) to connect UDS and haptics to RP GPIO
1/20 - 3 hrs - researched tflite model, began rewriting CNN in tensorflow
1/21 - 3 hrs - rewrote and retrained base model in tensorflow, got to similar accuracy level as before
1/22 - 3 hrs - met with professor, discussed changing rasp pi to pico, researched power options for the pi
1/27 - 3 hrs - modified example object detection model from github to run without visualization to speed up FPS  and inference, added basic gpio integration 
1/28 - 3 hrs - set up headless script on raspberry pi, got it to work, downloaded tflite model onto rasp pi 
1/29 - 2 hrs - discussed helmet shape modifications, added lidar gpio code to headless script
2/2-2/3 - 3 hrs - alpha demo, modify initial helmet module design after receiving print
2/10 - 3 hrs - test camera object detection with haptics and start systemd script
2/12 - 2.5 hrs - beta check in  meeting + rewiring/adjustment of layout in helmet case
2/17 - 3 hrs - research multiple uart configuration on raspberry pi and debug issues with enabling uart2, also fixed systemd script and set alphabuild.py to run on startup
2/17 - 2 hrs - modify code for two lidars
2/18 - 3 hrs - test systemd functionality by attaching haptics
2/19 - 3 hrs - fully integrated both lidars and both haptic motors, fixed issues with uart, and completed alpha testing - verified that lidars and haptic correctly detect motion in specified range and
                show the correct side that object is on
