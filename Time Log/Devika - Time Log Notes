Time Log:
1/15 - setup up log in github as 3rd part reference
1/19 - 3 hrs - reviewed work from last semester, researched and purchased LIDAR sensor to use, found 
  example raspberry pi code to connect UDS and haptics
1/19 - 2 hrs - moved CNN model over to Colab, re-trained, and attempted conversion from Pytorch to tflite
1/20 - 2 hrs - created sample Python script (bat.py) to connect UDS and haptics to RP GPIO
1/20 - 3 hrs - researched tflite model, began rewriting CNN in tensorflow
1/21 - 3 hrs - rewrote and retrained base model in tensorflow, got to similar accuracy level as before
1/22 - 3 hrs - met with professor, discussed changing rasp pi to pico, researched power options for the pi
1/27 - 3 hrs - modified example object detection model from github to run without visualization to speed up FPS  and inference, added basic gpio integration 
1/28 - 3 hrs - set up headless script on raspberry pi, got it to work, downloaded tflite model onto rasp pi 
1/29 - 2 hrs - discussed helmet shape modifications, added lidar gpio code to headless script
2/2-2/3 - 3 hrs - alpha demo, modify initial helmet module design after receiving print
2/10 - 3 hrs - test camera object detection with haptics
