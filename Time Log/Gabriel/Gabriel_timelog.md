# Gabriel Timelog for Design II

## 01/19 - Team Meeting
### 2 hrs
- Discussed plan for the semester
- Divided work for the alpha build
- I was tasked with getting us back to where we were last semester, since we had our work erased and had a fresh sd card for the pi
- Initial environment setup for the pi

## 01/20 - Pi ML Camera Debug Session
## 5 hrs
- Had this debug session to get us back to where we were last semester
- Found out that there were some bugs regarding versions of different requirements for the ML camera script
- The most pressing issue was numpy version, which took me a while to figure out
- Removed custom numpy installation from python venv and defaulted to the default numpy system installation (version 1.19.5)
